GoSCM: A scheme interpreter written in Go, designed to be a great extension
language

A note on terminology:
===

Despite the fact that "function" and "procedure" are often used interchangably,
"foreign" is used in this project to mean Go functions that have been bound to
scheme and procedure/proc are used to mean scheme procedures. Both are
compatible with the interface "Function", which means we can apply them to a
list of arguments.
